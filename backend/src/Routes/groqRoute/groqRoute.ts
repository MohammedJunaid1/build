                    - Use self-closing tags where applicable (e.g., <img />, <input />).
                    - Replace class attributes with className.
                    - Make sure all attributes are properly quoted.
                    - Ensure the structure is semantically correct for use in a React component.

                    ${chat.choices[0]?.message?.content}

                    Please ensure the generated HTML is ready to be copied directly into a React component without further modification.`)
